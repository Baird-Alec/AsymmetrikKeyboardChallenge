# AsymmetrikKeyboardChallenge

Coding Challenge for Asymmetrik

My apologies, I saved my completed project locally,
but didn't update the repo here to reflect my changes. 
I appreciate you looking over this again, it works as expected.


In order to run this program, you must copy the Java files found in src to the IDE of your choice,
and then run the Main.java file.
I was planning on using binary searches to reduce O time for my searches, but I tried to stay 
within the 4 hour timeframe given, so this solution isn't fully optimized.
